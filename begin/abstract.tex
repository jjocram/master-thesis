    \chapter*{Abstract}
    Trying to explain to a robot what to do is a difficult undertaking, and only specific types of people have been able to do so far, such as programmers or operators who have learned how to use controllers to communicate with a robot. My internship's goal was to create and develop a framework that would make it easier. The system uses deep learning techniques to recognize a set of hand gestures, both static and dynamic. Then, based on the gesture, it sends a command to a robot. To be as generic as feasible, the communication is implemented using ROS. Furthermore, the user can add new recognizable gestures and link them to new robot actions; a finite state automaton enforces the user's input verification and correct action sequence. Finally, the user can  create and utilize a macro saved in a text file to describe a sequence of actions performable by a robot.
